# How to add new material
To generate  new pages or update info:
* Checkout this repo
* Make modifications or add files (like Projects or Blog Posts e.g.) to the Markdown files in the content folder
* Run the `hugo` command to generate the updated static html files to the public folder.
* Open the `public` git submodule (either in Gitkraken e.g. or by opening the public folder in a terminal) and push the changes.
* The changes will be live on Github page now

# Modifications to original project
* I have changed the theme's About widget to include work experience also. This means that the theme can't be automatically updated like described on the original project's documentation.
