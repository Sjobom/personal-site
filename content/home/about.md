# Biography

I am Anders Sj√∂bom, a Computer Science student at KTH, Stockholm with a great passion for software engineering and helping people with new technologies.

I have a company where I do software development besides my studies. [Contact me](mailto:asjobom@kth.se) if you have a business proposal!

In my free time I love being in the nature hiking, cross-country skiing or running [orienteering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orienteering).
